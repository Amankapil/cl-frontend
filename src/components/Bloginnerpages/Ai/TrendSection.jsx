          So, AI finally became a thing. It is wildly different from its
          dystopian counterpart in sci-fi movies. It was supposed to control and
          destroy humanity. Surprisingly, it is creating things, which was
          thought to be not possible just a few years ago..

          Actually, no. The previous statement is flawed. AI by itself cannot
          create anything. It still needs humans to give prompts, to guide it.
          AI at this stage is just a mere tool. Something that aids us with the
          completion of a task. There are speculations that AI one day might
          take over people’s jobs. Well if it does, who cares? A global poll
          conducted by Gallup says that 85% of the world's one billion full-time
          workers are unhappy at their jobs.

          Some might say the chaos AI is causing in many disciplines is similar
          to what mathematicians felt when the digital calculator was introduced
          (yes, a very bad analogy. But it gets the point through). Can it be of
          any use without the person using it? No. Did it replace
          mathematicians? Absolutely not. Did it help them solve complex
          problems? Yes.

          Well, that went on a tangent. Instead of worrying about who loses
          their job and who doesn’t, here are a few AI tools hand-picked by
          yours truly to help you stay ahead of the competition and keep your
          job.

          This is an AI color pair generation tool. You have to select 50 (yes
          50) colors from pre-existing colors while getting started. This trains
          the AI model and after a few minutes, you will have infinite color
          pairs available for you to choose from. Khroma also has a “bias”
          system where you get to control the percentage of color pairs that are
          the ones you picked vs color pairs that are added by the AI model.
          What makes this tool stand out is- you can choose to generate color
          palettes and gradients from the chosen and suggested colors. And you
          can always go back and change the 50 colors.

          Fontjoy is pretty straightforward. No signing up, no getting started
          just straight to generating fresh and interesting font pairs. You get
          a slider to select the amount of contrast between the fonts. On top of
          this, if you already have some fonts in mind and want to see how they
          pair up, you can select them manually. Here’s where its drawback comes
          to light. Unfortunately, you can only select fonts from Google Fonts.
          But look at the bright side, while Google Fonts can be limiting, it
          has a collection of over 1,400 fonts so I’m sure you will come across
          something interesting.

          Autodraw is more like MS Paint with AI. It is very easy to use and is
          quick at predicting what you are trying to draw. You can create
          vector-like artwork quickly, but that's the only thing you can create.
          The artwork from the database will pretty much remain the same and
          won’t change based on the look you are going for. For example, no
          matter how stylistic you want to show a smiley, the AI will recognize
          it as a smiley and give you 3 smiley faces to pick from. These 3 will
          remain the same for the smiley section. So, it can get repetitive. But
          for someone who is looking to create some nice vector line art
          quickly, this might just be a goldmine.

          Art Breeder is a powerhouse when it comes to artwork generation,
          manipulation. It uses GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) to
          generate artwork. There are many features to explore. What stood out
          the most is a feature called “Director”. You get an AI assistant that
          writes prompts for you and generates the artwork and all of this is
          free of credits.
        </p>

        >
          The Mixer feature is also very powerful. It uses already existing
          images (from your device or its ever-growing community) as a “visual”
          version of a prompt to generate artwork out of the elements present in
          the images. This can be a major help for those struggling with prompts
          and cannot generate the artwork which they have in mind.

          Using Framer you can build a homepage in less than 2 minutes. It also
          allows you to change the color palette and the font post-generation.
          You can also edit individual sections manually. Though the art
          direction cannot be interpreted exactly and you might get results
          different than the one you had in mind, it's a great starting point.
          You can also choose from their extensive templates if AI doesn’t work
          out for you. Overall, Framer is a great tool to build and publish
          websites quickly (especially if it's a single page).

          Alright, so let's wrap this up! AI design tools are basically like the
          creative Swiss Army knives of the digital world. These tools aim to
          streamline and enhance the design workflow by automating tasks,
          generating design elements, and providing suggestions based on
          algorithms and data analysis. By doing so, AI design tools can
          potentially increase efficiency and free up designers to focus on
          higher-level creative decisions.

          The impact of AI on design is an ongoing topic of discussion, with
          both potential benefits and ethical considerations being debated
          within the design community and beyond.
